# Handwritten-Charecter-Recognition
Handwritten Character Recognition is widely used to read and understand characters from images  and covert them to digital content. Character recognition is a fundamental, but most challenging in  the field of pattern recognition with large number of useful applications. It has been an intense field  of research since the early days of computer science due to it being a natural way of interactions  between computers and humans. More precisely Character recognition is the process of detecting  and recognizing characters from the input image and converts it into ASCII or other equivalent  machine editable form.
